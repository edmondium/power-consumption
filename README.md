# Power consumption
Predicting each appliance’s on/off status from gross power readings, using the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE, publicly available [here](https://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/browse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2017/ReadMe_DALE-2017.html)) dataset. UK-DALE records both whole-house power consumption and usage from each individual appliance every 6 seconds from 5 households. We demonstrate our solution using the data from house #2, for which the dataset includes a total of 19 appliances’ power consumption. Given the granularity of the dataset (a sample rate of ⅙ Hz), it is difficult to estimate appliances with relatively tiny power usage. Based on a data exploration study shown below, we selected eight appliances out of the original 19 items as our target appliances: a treadmill, washing machine, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, electric kettle, rice cooker and “cooker,” a.k.a., electric stovetop.
